    <h2>LETTERS TO ABSTRACTIONS.</h2>

    <h3>NO. VIII.&mdash;TO LAZINESS.</h3>

    <p>BEST (AND BEST-ABUSED) OF ABSTRACTIONS,</p>

    <p>My heart positively warms to you as I write. At this precise
    moment I can think of a hundred different things that I ought
    to be doing. For instance, I have not written to TOM, who is in
    the wilds of Canada, for months. His last letter ended with a
    pathetic appeal for an answer.</p>

    <p>"Never mind, old chap," he said, "about not having any news.
    Little details that you may think too insignificant to relate
    are bound to interest me in this deserted spot. I am sure you
    occasionally meet I some of our friends of the old days. Tell
    them I often think of them and all the fun we used to have
    together. It all seems like a dream to me now. Let me know what
    any of them are doing. I heard six months ago from a fellow who
    was touring out here that JACK BUMPUS was married. If it is
    really our old JACK, congratulate him, and give him my love. I
    don't know his present address. But, whatever you do, write. A
    letter from you is like water in the desert."</p>

    <div class="figright"

        <a href="images/277.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>When I read that letter I became full of the noblest
    resolutions. Not another day should pass, I vowed, before I
    answered it. So I prepared a great many sheets of thin
    note-paper, carefully selected a clean nib and sat down at my
    writing-table to begin. As I did so my eyes fell upon <i>Martin
    Chuzzlewit</i>, which was lying within easy reach. The book
    seemed positively to command me to read it for the tenth time.
    I took it up, and in another moment <i>Mrs. Gamp</i> had taken
    possession of me. My writing-chair was uncomfortable. I
    transferred myself into an arm-chair. Is it necessary to add
    that I did not write to TOM? His letter is getting frayed and
    soiled from being constantly in my pocket. Day after day it
    accompanies me on my daily round, unanswered and seemingly
    unanswerable. For I feel it to be a duty to write, and my mind
    abhors a duty. The letter weighs upon my conscience like lead.
    A few strokes of the pen would remove the burden, but I simply
    cannot screw myself up to the task. That is one of the things I
    ought to do.</p>

    <p>Again, ought I not to call on the WHITTLESEAS? Mr. and Mrs.
    WHITTLESEA have simply overflowed with kindness towards me. I
    never enjoyed anything more than the week I spent at their
    house in Kent a short time ago. They are now in town, and, what
    is more, they know that I am in town too. Of course I ought to
    call. It's my plain duty, and that is, as far as I can tell,
    the only reason which absolutely prevents me from calling upon
    that hospitable family. Why need I go through the long list of
    my pressing duties? I ought to write my article on "Modern
    Theosophy: A Psychological Parallel," for the next number of
    <i>The Brain</i>. I ought to visit my dentist; I ought to have
    my hair cut. But I shall do none of these things. On the other
    hand, it is absolutely unnecessary that I should write to you.
    No evil would befall me if I waited another year, or even
    omitted altogether to write to you. And that is the precise
    reason why I am now addressing you. As a matter of fact, I like
    you. As I have already said, the performance of strict duties
    is irksome to me. It is you, my dear LAZINESS, who forbid me to
    perform them, and thus save me from many an uncongenial task.
    That is why I like you.</p>

    <p>And, after all, the common abuse of you is absurd. I have
    heard grave and industrious persons declare emphatically that
    any one who allows himself to fall under your sway debars
    himself utterly from every chance of success. Fiddlesticks! I
    snap my fingers at such folly. What do these gentlemen say to
    the case of FIGTREE, the great Q.C.? Everybody knows that
    FIGTREE is, without exception, the most indolent man in the
    world. Let any doubter walk down Middle Temple Lane and ask the
    first young barrister he meets what he thinks of FIGTREE. I am
    ready to wager my annual income that the reply will be, "What,
    Old FIGTREE! Why, he's the laziest man at the Bar. I thought
    everybody knew that." I may be told, of course, that FIGTREE
    appears in all the big cases&mdash;that his management of them
    is extraordinarily successful; that the Judges defer to him;
    that his speech in the Camberwell poisoning case lasted a day
    and a half, and is acknowledged to be a masterpiece of forensic
    eloquence, fit to rank with the best efforts of ERSKINE; that
    his fees always exceed ten thousand pounds a year and that his
    book on <i>Fines and Recoveries</i> is a monument of industry.
    All this I shall hear from some member of the outside public,
    who does not know his FIGTREE. But the fact remains. FIGTREE is
    the most indolent being alive. I doubt if he can be induced to
    read a brief before he goes into Court. Many are the tales told
    by those who have been his juniors of the marvellous skill and
    address with which FIGTREE has time after time extricated
    himself from awkward situations into which he had been led by
    his ignorance of the details of the case in which he happened
    to be engaged. In the sensational libel case of <i>Bagwell</i>
    v. <i>Muter</i>, FIGTREE, as you must remember, appeared for
    the defendant. When the plaintiff's Junior Counsel had opened
    the pleadings, FIGTREE actually got up, and, had not his own
    Junior pulled him down, he would then and there have opened the
    case for the plaintiff. Yet FIGTREE's cross-examination of that
    same plaintiff, travelling as it did over a long period of
    time, and dealing with a most complicated story, in which dates
    were of the first importance, is still cited by those who heard
    it as the most remarkable display of its kind which the English
    Courts have afforded for years past. Whether the unfortunate
    BAGWELL, whom it showed conclusively to be a swindler and an
    impostor, has an equal admiration for it, I know not, nor is
    he, I fancy, likely to tell us, even when he returns from the
    prison which is now the scene of his labours. How FIGTREE, who
    at the outset did not even know on which side he appeared,
    managed in the time at his command to master this intricate
    case, must ever remain a mystery. HARRY ADDLESTONE, his Junior,
    is accustomed to talk darkly of a marvellous chronological
    analysis of the case which he had prepared for his leader, and
    evidently wishes me to believe that he, rather than FIGTREE, is
    to be credited with the success achieved. But the Solicitors
    have not yet withdrawn their confidence from FIGTREE to
    transfer it to ADDLESTONE.</p>

    <p>Here, then, is an instance of a perfectly indolent man
    rising higher and higher every year on the ladder of
    professional advancement. I can only attribute it, my dear
    LAZINESS, to your beneficent influence, which preserves the
    great barrister from the weary labours to which his rivals
    daily submit. They say of him that he knows nothing of law. If
    I grant that, it merely proves that a knowledge of law is not
    required for success in the profession of the law. The
    deduction is dangerous, but obvious, and I recommend it warmly
    to all who are about to be called to the Bar.</p>

    <p>I don't think I have anything more to say to you to-day;
    indeed, I know that you would be the last to desire that the
    writing of this letter should he in any way irksome to me.
    Besides, it is five o'clock P.M. My arm-chair invites me. I
    feel tired, and, that being so, I am convinced it would he an
    act of pedantic folly to deny myself the sweet refreshment of
    half-an-hour's sleep. Farewell, kindly one. I shall always
    rejoice to honour you, and celebrate your praise.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours, with all goodwill,<br />
    DIOGENES ROBINSON.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;I reopen this letter to say that I have just read
    in an evening paper a terrible account of the total destruction
    by a tornado of the town in Canada which was poor TOM's place
    of exile. "The loss of life," it is added, "has been great, and
    several Englishmen are amongst the victims." No names are
    given. Good gracious! If TOM has indeed perished, how am I ever
    to forgive myself for neglecting him? What must he have thought
    of me? I curse myself in vain for my&mdash;bah! What is the use
    of telling you this? The same paper informs me, in the elegant
    language appropriate to these occasions, that "Mr. FIGTREE,
    Q.C., has been offered, and has accepted, the vacant
    Lord-Justiceship of Appeal."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>AN OPPORTUNITY.&mdash;A Lyme Regis Correspondent sends us
    the following advertisement, found, he says, in the <i>Bridport
    News</i>; we omit dates and names:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>&mdash;&mdash; will SELL by AUCTION, Three Fine DAIRY
        COWS to calve <i>respectfully</i> in Dec., April, and May
        next. An excellent double-feeding chaff-cutter, &amp;c.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A respectful cow will no doubt fulfil her engagements
    honorably. "A double-feeding chaff-cutter" ought to be an
    acquisition to a fast set on a coach at the Derby, though of
    course his "double-feeding" powers would have to be amply
    provided for at luncheon time.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"The nearest thing to 'setting the Thames on fire,'" said a
    quiet traveller by the Underground, "is the announcement which
    you will now see at the St. James's Park Station:&mdash;'A
    LIGHT HERE FOR NIAGARA.'" "Why," exclaimed an irate passenger
    to the timid suggestion of the above, "of course it doesn't
    mean <i>that</i>." Then he added, contemptuously, "Get out!"
    Which he did.</p>

    <h2>"DICK" POWER.</h2>

    <p>When the House of Commons meets in February, it will find
    many vacant places. Save, perhaps, on that sacred to the memory
    of OLD MORALITY, none will draw towards it such sorrowful
    glances as the bench below the Gangway, where, last Session,
    DICK POWER's smiling face was found. Everyone in the House knew
    "DICK," and all liked him&mdash;a modest-mannered,
    merry-hearted man, whom a strange destiny had not only dragged
    into political life, but, as Whip of the Parnellite Party, had
    made him the official representative of a body for the most
    part socially unknown, and disliked with a fervour happily not
    often imported into Parliamentary warfare. DICK POWER, whilst
    never swerving by a hair's breadth from loyalty to his
    colleagues and his leader, so bore himself that he was welcome
    in any Parliamentary circle, from "GOSSET's Room" to the floor
    of the House, which he sometimes "took" to deliver a witty
    speech in support of a Motion for adjourning over the Derby. He
    was only in his fortieth year, married scarce a fortnight, when
    comes the blind Fury with the abhorrëd shears and slits the
    thin-spun thread. "LYCIDAS is dead!"; but he will long be
    remembered as shedding through seventeen years a genial light
    on Irish politics, too often obscured by aggressive vulgarity,
    and the sacrifice of patriotic interests to the ends of
    personal vanity.</p>

    <h2>ONLY FANCY!</h2>

    <p>We are in a position to state that overtures were recently
    made to a well-known and popular member of the aristocracy in
    connection with a certain high office lately vacated. It is
    felt that a gentleman with the varied experience and capacity
    indicated by the circumstance (to which we may allude as not
    involving breach of confidence), that his name was successively
    mentioned in connection with the offices, recently vacant, of
    Postmaster-General, Undersecretary of State for Foreign
    Affairs, and Leader of the House of Commons, is peculiarly well
    qualified for the post.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The PRIME MINISTER has, we learn, been much gratified by the
    receipt of a letter volunteered by one of his colleagues,
    expressing generous satisfaction at his selection of Mr. ARTHUR
    BALFOUR to the Leadership of the House of Commons. It was the
    more pleasing as the name of Lord SALISBURY's correspondent
    had, in Conservative circles, been prominently mentioned in
    connection with the office. "It is true," the Abounding Baron
    wrote, "that the public with unerring instinct has looked in
    another direction. I should therefore like to be the first to
    say that your Lordship has done well in recognising the
    services to the Unionist cause performed by Mr. BALFOUR. Of
    course there may be other openings, and in case your Lordship
    has occasion to communicate with me, it may be convenient to
    mention that, having come to town this morning and transacted
    business at my office in Bouverie Street, I am about to return
    to my country residence at Stow-in-the-Wold."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is announced that Lord SALISBURY's new house at Beaulieu
    is to be let furnished for the winter months, the PREMIER not
    intending to return till the Spring. We understand that one of
    Mr. GLADSTONE's friends and admirers is in treaty for the
    residence, intending to place it for a few weeks at the
    disposal of the Leader of the Opposition. We have not yet heard
    how far this happily-conceived scheme has progressed.</p>

        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>The roof of Milan Cathedral; the
        innumerable statues and fretted pinnacles show in dazzling
        relief against the intense blue sky. Through the open-work
        of the parapet is seen the vast Piazza, with its yellow toy
        tram-cars, and the small crawling figures which cast
        inordinately long shadows. All around is a maze of pale
        brown roofs, and beyond, the green plain blending on the
        horizon with dove-coloured clouds in a quivering violet
        haze.</i> CULCHARD <i>is sitting by a small doorway at the
        foot of a flight of steps leading to the Spire.</i></p>

    <p><i>Culchard</i> (<i>meditating</i>). I think MAUD must have
    seen from the tone in which I said I preferred to remain below,
    that I object to that cousin of hers perpetually coming about
    with us as he does. She's far too indulgent to him&mdash;a
    posing, affected prig, always talking about the wonderful
    things he's <i>going</i> to write! He had the impudence to tell
    me I didn't know the most elementary laws of the sonnet this
    morning! Withering repartee seems to have no effect whatever on
    him, I wish I had some of PODBURY's faculty for flippant chaff!
    I wonder if he and the PRENDERGASTS really are at Milan. I
    certainly thought I recognised &mdash;&mdash;. If they are,
    it's very bad taste of them, after the pointed way in which
    they left Bellagio. I only hope we shan't&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Here the figure of</i> Miss PRENDERGAST <i>suddenly
        emerges from the door</i>; CULCHARD <i>rises and stands
        aside to let her pass; she returns his salutation
        distantly, and passes on with her chin in the air; her
        brother follows, with a side-jerk of recognition.</i>
        PODBURY <i>comes last, and halts undecidedly.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>with a rather awkward laugh</i>). Here we
    are again, eh? (<i>Looks after</i> Miss P., <i>hesitates, and
    finally sits down by</i> CULCHARD.) Where's the fascinating
    Miss TROTTER? How do you come to be off duty like this?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>stiffly</i>). The fascinating Miss TROTTER
    is up above with VAN BOODELER, so my services are not
    required.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Up above? And HYPATIA just gone up with BOB!
    Whew, there'll be ructions presently! Well out of it, you and
    I! So it's BOODELER's turn now? That's rough on
    <i>you</i>&mdash;after HYPATIA had whistled poor old BOB off.
    As much out in the cold as ever, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I am nothing of the kind. I find him
    distasteful to me, and avoid him as much as I can, that's all.
    I wish, PODBURY, er&mdash;I <i>almost</i> wish you could have
    stayed with me, instead of allowing the PRENDERGASTS to carry
    you off as you did. You would have kept VAN BOODELER in
    order.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Much obliged, old chap; but I'm otherwise
    engaged. Being kept in order myself. Oh, I <i>like</i> it, you
    know. She's developing my mind like winking. Spent the whole
    morning at the Brera, mugging up these old Italian Johnnies.
    They really are clinkers, you know. RAPHAEL, eh?&mdash;and
    GIOTTO, and MANTEGNA, and all that lot. As HYPATIA says, for
    intensity of&mdash;er religious feeling, and&mdash;and subtlety
    of symbolism, and&mdash;and so on, they simply take the
    cake&mdash;romp in, and the rest nowhere! I'm getting quite the
    connoisseur, I can tell you!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Evidently. I suppose there's no chance of
    a&mdash;a <i>reconciliation</i> up there? [<i>With some
    alarm.</i></p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Don't you be afraid. When HYPATIA once gets her
    quills up, they don't subside so easily! Hallo! isn't this old
    TROTTER?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>That gentleman appears in the doorway.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> Why, Mr. PODBURY, so you've come along here?
    That's <i>right</i>! And how do you like Milan? I like the
    place first-rate&mdash;it's a live city, Sir. And I like this
    old cathedral, too; it's well constructed&mdash;they've laid
    out money on it. I call it real ornamental, all these little
    figgers they've stuck around&mdash;and not two of 'em a pair
    either. Now, they might have had 'em all alike, and no one any
    the wiser up so high as this; but it certainly gives it more
    variety, too, having them different. Well, I'm going up as high
    as ever I <i>can</i> go. You two better come along up with
    me.</p>

    <h4><i>On the Top.</i></h4>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>as she perceives</i> Miss T. <i>and her
    companion</i>). Now, BOB, pray remember all I've told you! [BOB
    <i>turns away, petulantly.</i></p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>aside, to</i> VAN B.). I guess the air's
    got cooler up here, CHARLEY. But if that girl imagines she's
    going to freeze <i>me</i>! (<i>Advancing to</i> Miss P.) Why,
    my dear, it's almost too sweet for anything, meeting you
    again!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> You're extremely kind, MAUD; I wish I could
    return the compliment; but really, after what took place at
    Bellagio, I&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>taking her arm</i>). Well, I'll own up to
    being pretty horrid&mdash;and so were you; but there don't seem
    any sense in our meeting up here like a couple of strange cats
    on tiles. I won't fly out anymore, there! I'm just dying for a
    reconciliation; and so is Mr. VAN BOODELER. The trouble I've
    had to console that man! He never met anybody before haff so
    interested in the great Amurrcan Novel. And he's wearying for
    another talk. So you'd better give that hatchet a handsome
    funeral, and come along and take pity on him.</p>

        <p>[HYP., <i>after a struggle, yields, half-reluctantly,
        and allows herself to be taken across to</i> Mr. VAN B.,

        together.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Bob P.</i> (<i>who has been prudently keeping in the
    background till now, decides that his chance has come</i>). How
    do you do. Miss TROTTER? It's awfully jolly to meet you again
    like this!</p>

    <p><i>Miss. T.</i> Well, I guess that remark would have been
    more convincing if you'd made it a few minutes earlier.</p>

    <p><i>Bob</i>. I&mdash;I&mdash;you see, I didn't know.... I was
    afraid&mdash;I rather thought&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> You don't get much further with <i>rather</i>
    thinking, as a general rule, than if you didn't think at all.
    But if you're at all anxious to run away the way you did at
    Bellagio, you needn't be afraid <i>I'll</i> hinder you.</p>

    <p><i>Bob</i>. (<i>earnestly</i>). Run away! <i>Do</i> you
    think I'd have gone if&mdash;I've felt dull enough ever since,
    without <i>that</i>.'</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Oh, I expect you've had a beautiful time.
    <i>We</i> have.</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>coming up</i>). ROBERT, I thought you
    wanted to see the Alps? You should come over to the other side,
    and&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I'll undertake that he sees the Alps,
    darling, presently&mdash;when we're through our talk.</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> As you please, dear. But (<i>pointedly</i>)
    did I not see Mr. CULCHARD below?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> You don't mean to say you're wearied of Mr.
    VAN BOODELER <i>already</i>! Well, Mr. CULCHARD will be along
    soon, and I'll loan him to you. I'll tell him you're vurry
    anxious to converse with him some more. He's just coming along
    now, with Mr. PODBURY and Poppa.</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>under her breath</i>). MAUD! if you
    <i>dare</i>&mdash;!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Don't you <i>dare</i> me, then&mdash;or
    you'll see. But I don't want to be mean unless I'm obliged
    to.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[Mr. TROTTER, <i>followed by</i> CULCHARD <i>and</i>
        PODBURY, <i>arrives at the upper platform</i>. CULCHARD
        <i>and</i> PODBURY <i>efface themselves as much as
        possible.</i> Mr. TROTTER <i>greets</i> Miss PRENDERGAST
        <i>heartily.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> Well now, I call this sociable, meeting all
    together again like this. I don't see why in the land we didn't
    <i>keep</i> together. I've been saying so to my darter here,
    ever since Bellagio&mdash;ain't that so, MAUD? And <i>she</i>
    didn't know just how it came about either.</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>hurriedly</i>). We&mdash;we had to be
    getting on. And I am afraid we must say good-bye now, Mr.
    TROTTER. I want BOB and Mr. PODBURY to see the Da Vinci fresco,
    you know, before the light goes. (Bob <i>mutters a highly
    disrespectful wish concerning that work of Art.</i>) We
    <i>may</i> see you again, before we leave for Verona.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> Verona? Well, I don't care if I see Verona
    myself. Seems a pity to separate now we <i>have</i> met,
    <i>don't</i> it? See here, now, we'll <i>all</i> go along to
    Verona together&mdash;how's that, MAUD? Start whenever
    <i>you</i> feel like it, Miss PRENDERGAST. How does that
    proposal strike you? I'll be real hurt if you cann't take to my
    idea.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> The fact is, Poppa, HYPATIA isn't just sure
    that Mr. PRENDERGAST wouldn't
    object.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"
       id="page281"></a>[pg 281]</span>

    <p><i>Bob P.</i> I&mdash;object? Not <i>much</i>! Just what I
    should <i>like</i>, seeing Verona with&mdash;all
    <i>together</i>, you know!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Then I guess <i>that's</i> fixed. (<i>Aside,
    to</i> Miss P., <i>who is speechless</i>). Come, you haven't
    the heart to go and disappoint my poor Cousin CHARLEY by saying
    you won't go! He'll be perfectly enchanted to be under
    vow&mdash;unless you've filled up <i>all</i> the vacancies
    already! (<i>Aloud, to</i> VAN B., <i>as he approaches</i>.)
    We've persuaded Miss PRENDERGAST to join our party. I hope you
    feel equal to entertaining her?</p>

    <p><i>Van B.</i> I shall be proud to be permitted to try.
    (<i>To</i> Miss P.) Then I may take it that you agree with me
    that the function of the future American fictionist will
    be&mdash; [<i>They move away, conversing.</i></p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>To</i> CULCH.) I say, old fellow, we're to
    be travelling companions again, after all. And a jolly good
    thing, too, <i>I</i> think!... eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Oh, h'm&mdash;quite so. That is&mdash;but no
    doubt it will be an advantage&mdash;(<i>with a glance at</i>
    Van B., <i>who is absorbed in</i> Miss P.'s
    <i>conversation</i>)&mdash;in&mdash;er&mdash;<i>some</i>
    respects. (<i>To himself.</i>) Hardly from poor dear PODBURY's
    point of view, I'm afraid, though! However, if <i>he</i> sees
    nothing&mdash;! [<i>He shrugs his shoulders, pityingly.</i></p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>Pocket-books for next year are coming in. Which for choice?
    "<i>Solvitur ambulando</i>" should be the resolution of the
    difficulty, given by one firm at least, that firm being
    "WALKER." They are handy, and conveniently pocketable, but to
    "The chiels amang ye taking notes," plain leaves, and no fruit,
    and no dates, we should say, would be preferable. They're
    reasonable prices, and you can't expect to get 'em for nothing;
    if you do&mdash;"WALKER!"</p>

    <p>The Baron highly approves of Messrs. DE LA RUE's
    pocket-books. It is pleasant to have something in one's pocket,
    even if only a book. As to account-books and diaries&mdash;well
    enter nothing therein but what has been pleasant and
    profitable, and most diarians who adopt this rule will not find
    their memoranda overcrowded at the end of the year. "Letts be
    happy, while we can, and good luck to you, Ladies all, in 1892.
    Leap year!" quoth the Baron. "Over you go like the villagers in
    the German story, after the sheep, into the sea of matrimony,
    where may you all get on swimmingly." <i>À propos</i>, Mesdames
    BLYTHE and GAY say that the Christmas Number of <i>Woman</i>,
    produced by a number of women, is as full of attractive power
    as the Magnetic Lady herself.</p>

    <p>"ARROWSMITH's Shilling Sensational, by 'a New Author,'"
    quoth the Baron, "would, methought, serve <i>pour me
    distraire</i>." The "New Author" uses the remarkably new device
    of a mole on the lost child's breast. Isn't that original?
    <i>Miss Box</i> and <i>Miss Cox</i> are lost, and found. "Have
    you a mole on your left breast?" "Yes!" "Then it is both of
    you!" Charming! So useful is the explanation that "Hanwell is a
    little village, a few miles from London." Perhaps it is the
    locality, there or thereabouts, where this thrillingly
    interesting tale&mdash;which could have been told in fifty
    pages, and needn't have been told at all&mdash;was written.
    Well, well, "All's Hanwell that ends Hanwell," and "I've
    galloped through a worse story before now," quoth the Baron,
    yawning, and so to bed.</p>

    <p>In <i>John Leech, His Life and Work</i> (BENTLEY) Mr. FRITH
    quotes from an anonymous but obviously not an original
    authority, the dictum, "It is the happiness of such a life (as
    LEECH's) that there is so little to be told of it." Mr. BENTLEY
    has produced two handsome volumes worthy the reputation of his
    ancient and honourable house. They enshrine admirable
    reproductions of some of LEECH's best work, selected by the
    trained hand and sympathetic eye of Mr. FRITH. These are and
    will remain the chief attractions of a work to which the Baron,
    in common with the civilised world, has been looking forward to
    with interest, and of whose realisation he regrets to hear so
    disappointing an account from his trusty "Co." It is difficult
    to find dates in this higgledy-piggledy chance-medley of facts
    and opinions. But we all know that LEECH died in October, 1864.
    It was in <i>Mr. Punch's</i> pages that he found the true field
    for his heaven-born genius For twenty years at least he was one
    of the most prominent, best known, and best liked men in
    England. Surely within that period there must lie to the hand
    of the dilligent seeker material for a memoir worthy to be
    linked with the name of JOHN LEECH. Mr. FRITH has not given us
    such a book, and criticism is only partly disarmed by the
    comical reiteration of confession that he has failed in his
    appointed task. For what he has to say in the way of making
    known to the world the man JOHN LEECH, a very thin volume would
    have sufficed, even had he included the more useful of his
    remarks on LEECH's work and his method. But there being two
    volumes to fill, Mr. FRITH genially summarises <i>The
    Physiology of Evening Parties</i>, by Mr. ALBERT SMITH; <i>Mr.
    Sponge's Sporting Tour</i>, and other not very high-class
    literature, whose only claim to being remembered is that LEECH
    illustrated them. Of <i>The Marchioness of Brinvilliers</i>,
    ALBERT SMITH's attempt to rival the attractions of the
    <i>Newgate Calendar</i>, Mr. FRITH positively gives two whole
    chapters! He allots one to the <i>Bon Gaultier Ballads</i>, and
    nineteen mortal pages to telling the <i>Story of Miss
    Kilmansegg</i>, with copious extracts from that easily
    accessible work.</p>

    <p>This is not Memoir-writing, it is book-making. The reader
    can skip these chapters, and, diligently searching, will find
    here and there a ray of light thrown on this beautiful placid
    life, weighed down as it was from earliest manhood by family
    circumstances at which Mr. FRITH delicately hints. "Give,
    give!" was, truly, the cry of the daughters of the horseleach.
    There are, however, several other anecdotes contributed by
    personal friends of LEECH's, who have come to Mr. FRITH's
    assistance, and succeed in the main in making the book an
    interesting one, as giving the outside world some glimpses of a
    sweet and manly character. The volumes are crowded with
    illustrations. These are LEECH's own work, and make the volumes
    worth more than their published price.</p>

    <p>It is usually supposed that Australia is topsey-turvey mad,
    but in India it seems that matters also go by contraries, when
    compared with their mode of procedure at home. A lawsuit has
    been occasioned in Calcutta through white ants devouring a
    will. In England our Aunts (who are generally whites) make
    wills (bless them!) and <i>we</i> devour them, or at least live
    on the proceeds.</p>

    <h4>(<i>Extracts from Letters found in a German
    Post-bag.</i>)</h4>

    <h4><i>To a Bishop.</i></h4>

    <p>It has occurred to me that your sermons are not quite as
    good as they should be. You do not seem to grasp your subject
    with sufficient strength. I have not time to come to listen to
    you, as I have other pressing engagements, and consequently
    write from hearsay. Still, I believe I have good reason for my
    strictures. However, that you may have an excellent example
    upon which to model your discourses in the future, I will
    myself visit your cathedral at a near date, and occupy your
    pulpit. I will wire ten minutes before I arrive with my
    sermon.</p>

    <h4><i>To a General.</i></h4>

    <p>I congratulate you upon the success of the recent
    manoeuvres. Nothing could have been finer than the manner in
    which the entire Army saluted me on my approach. Perhaps the
    bands might have played the National Anthem half-an-hour longer
    or so, but for all that, the effect was excellent. And now I
    have got a really splendid idea. And you must help me. I want
    to order all the troops to another part of the country without
    telling their officers, and then, when they least expect it,
    you and I will order a general assembly. It will be such a joke
    to see the commanders when they appear on parade without any
    soldiers! They will be so surprised! And sha'n't we laugh! But
    mind, not a word to anyone until we have had our fun. As an old
    soldier who has deserved well of his Fatherland, I rely on your
    discretion.</p>

    <p>I was at the performances in your play-house the other
    evening, and, as I told you at the time, was not at all
    satisfied with the representation. I informed you that when I
    had time I would jot down my complaints, and I am now keeping
    my promise. I don't like the costume of the Tragedy
    Queen&mdash;her heels are too high and why does she wear
    gloves? The Low Comedian does not make the most of his part. He
    has to walk about with a band-box. Now why does he not seize
    the opportunity to place it on a chair and sit upon it? This
    would have a very comical effect. I have seen it done, and it
    made me laugh. Please let him sit upon the band-box for the
    future. If he sits down accidentally the effect will be
    heightened. It will be very funny. By the way, let all the
    box-keepers give programmes free of charge to officers and
    ladies under forty. I shall soon be at the theatre again to
    attend a rehearsal. I will wire ten minutes before I come, so
    that you may have proper time to call your company together.
    Till then, you incompetent sausage, you can enjoy your Lager
    and pipe in peace!</p>

    <h4><i>To a Doctor.</i></h4>

    <p>I have been reading some of the Medical Journals, and I am

    is the proper way. It may be, but, on the other hand, it may
    not. Before you cut off another leg communicate with me, and I
    will fix a date (as early as I can&mdash;probably within six
    months), when I can see your patient, and give you my opinion.
    By the way, do not go your rounds until you hear from me, as I
    may want to see you at any time.</p>

    <h4><i>To a Coach-builder.</i></h4>

    <p>You don't know how to make a carriage. The other day I
    thought of a capital idea, but, for the moment, cannot remember
    it. However, I fancy it had something to do with square wheels.
    At any rate you had better not make any more carriages until I
    call. I will come as soon as I can&mdash;probably before Spring
    twelvemonths.</p>

    <h4><i>To a Relative.</i></h4>

    <p>Had not time to answer your letter before. I do not in the
    least agree with you. I hate people who do not mind their own
    business. Why not attend to your own, and leave mine alone? If
    you do not take care, <i>I will arrange to visit you in
    State!</i> So you had better mind what you are about!</p>

    <h2>A BOARD-SCHOOL CHRISTMAS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>An Anticipation of the not very Distant
    Future.</i>)</h4>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/287-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/287-2.png"
             alt="Reading newspapers at their Club." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>It was a very unseasonable Yule-tide. Instead of the
    old-fashioned mild weather that had been the constant companion
    of Christmas for many years, the ground was covered with snow
    and the river blocked with ice. However, thanks to modern
    improvements, the artisans had not been impeded in executing
    their four hours of labour as provided by a recent statute.
    They had been sitting at their Club (supported by the State),
    reading the newspapers purchased out of the rates, and were
    only annoyed that no food and drink was supplied them free
    gratis and for nothing.</p>

    <p>"It would never do," said an old workman, who remembered the
    eight-hour day that used to prevail at the end of the
    Nineteenth Century. "You see were we to have beer at will, the
    brewers' draymen might complain. It was once attempted, but the
    Licensed Victuallers made such a disturbance that the idea was
    abandoned."</p>

    <p>"There is something in what you say," observed a second
    workman; "but, for the life of me, I don't see why the Nation
    shouldn't provide bread."</p>

    <p>"No, there you are out!" cried a third. "I am a baker, and
    anything that interferes with my industry won't do."</p>

    <p>And so they talked, discussing this and that, until all the
    subjects of the leaders in the daily papers had been exhausted.
    It was then that one of the workmen suggested a walk and a pipe
    on the Embankment.</p>

    <p>So they lounged down the main thoroughfare of London, with
    its pleasant <i>cafés</i> and well-appointed
    <i>restaurants</i>, and came to the conclusion (for the
    fiftieth time) that it was far better than anything of the same
    kind in Paris, or any other of the capitals of Europe. They had
    all been abroad during their State-assisted vacation, and
    consequently had the chief towns of the world, so to speak, at
    their finger-tips. As they sauntered along, they came to a
    group of half-starved, perambulating performers, who were
    giving an entertainment to a crowd of bystanders. It was not a
    good programme. First a young woman in rags, played on an old
    piano, with decent precision, some extremely difficult
    variations of CHOPIN's <i>Funeral March</i>. She was followed
    by a man who painted a portrait of a leading statesman
    indifferently well. Then another man jumped into the river, and
    made his way in the cold water with the ease of a fifth-rate
    professional swimmer. Then a second young woman recited
    something or other in German, with an atrocious English accent.
    And the whole concluded with a lecture upon chemistry (given by
    a seedy-looking old man), which was illustrated with some
    ambitious, but feeble experiments.</p>

    <p>On the balance the performance was a bore, and the public
    were rather pleased than otherwise, when a police constable
    ordered the <i>troupe</i> "to move on." The poor people
    gathered together their <i>impedimenta</i> and prepared to obey
    the officer's behest. It was then that the performers came face
    to face with the artisans. There was a cry of recognition.</p>

    <p>"Why, would you believe it!" exclaimed one of the workmen,
    "if it isn't SALLY JONES, and TOMMY BROWN, and NORAH JENKINS,
    and HARRY SMITH!"</p>

    <p>The well-fed and the starving cordially greeted one another.
    Then there were mutual explanations, and the old man who had
    lectured upon chemistry had his
    say:&mdash;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page288"
       id="page288"></a>[pg 288]</span>

    <p>"You want to know why we are all starving, and why we are so
    much worse off than you, although we were educated at the same
    Board School? I will tell you. It was because you very wisely
    made up your minds to follow the occupations of your fathers.
    You became builders, bakers, coal-heavers and paviors.</p>

    <p>"Ah, we did that," sighed out the elderly workman, "because
    we were too backward to attempt anything better. We were not
    clever people like you! We couldn't play the piano, and paint
    and swim, and go in for chemistry. We were not clever enough,
    and had to put up with passing a very low standard."</p>

    <p>"Thank your lucky stars it was so," exclaimed the chemist,
    with tears in his eyes, "for your fate is happier than ours. We
    are all fifth-rate, and can do nothing else. We have no chance
    against those who have been born to this kind of thing, and we
    have forgotten how to do your work. So we are starving,
    and&mdash;"</p>

    <p>But here the old man was interrupted by a policeman, who
    ordered all of them to move on. And on they moved. Half one way
    and half the other.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>OUR OWN FINANCIAL COLUMN.</h2>

    <p>"CROESUS" has vanished! We can scarcely find it in our heart
    to add anything to this distressing statement; but for the sake
    of our readers whom he may have induced to patronise his
    financial schemes, we give a few slight details of the
    disaster.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/288-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/288-1.png"
             alt="Portrait of 'Croesus.'" /></a>Portrait of
             "Croesus."
    </div>

    <p>Four days ago enormous piles of letters began to arrive at
    our office. They were addressed to "CROESUS," and had been sent
    on to us from his last address marked "gone away; try office of
    <i>Punch</i>." We opened them. They were all threatening
    letters.</p>

    <p>"Why," wrote one angry gentleman, "have I heard nothing from
    you since I sent you my cheque for £10,000? Unless I receive a
    reply within a week, legal proceedings will be taken." The rest
    were similar in tone. Thereupon we resolved to call at the last
    address given to us by "CROESUS." It was somewhere in the Mile
    End Road. We arrived, entered, ascended the stairs, and found
    in a dingy back bed-room, three used half-penny stamps, a false
    nose, a pair of whiskers, and a large sheet of paper on which
    were written only these words: "Sold Again"&mdash;which
    obviously referred to some financial scheme or other. On
    inquiring of the landlady, we heard that her lodger had
    departed two days before, taking with him two large and heavy
    wooden chests. He had promised to return. We then consulted the
    police. They are very reticent, but consider they have got a
    clue.</p>

    <p>And here we owe it to our readers to make a confession. We
    have never set eyes on "CROESUS." We engaged him entirely on
    the strength of the most glowing recommendations from a whole
    bevy of Bank-Managers, including the Managers of the Bank of
    Lavajelli, of the Pei-ho Provinces, of Samarcand, of Ashanti
    and of Dodge County, U.S.A. All these gentlemen wrote in the
    most complimentary terms of "CROESUS." "He is a man," wrote the
    Manager of the Dodge County Bank, "whom I have had the honour
    to know intimately for a considerable number of years. Indeed,
    we were educated together, and not a day has passed since then
    without our meeting. I beg to state that I consider him
    thoroughly fitted for the responsible position of financial
    director of a high-class Metropolitan paper. His personal
    appearance is aristocratic and prepossessing, his manners have
    about them a distinction which impresses all who meet him, and
    his dress, though modest, is always pleasing. His complete
    command of twenty-four languages must be of the highest
    advantage to him in unravelling the tangled skein of
    international finance." Acting upon such testimonials we
    engaged "CROESUS." We have now reason to believe that we have
    been made the victims of a gross and cruel deception. An expert
    in handwriting, whom we have consulted, gives it as his
    opinion, that every single one of these recommendations is in
    the handwriting of "CROESUS" himself, and the police, after
    protracted inquiries, have assured us that the Banks, whose
    supposed managers addressed us in favour of "CROESUS," never
    had any actual existence at all.</p>

    <p>All we can do now is to assist justice by publishing
    herewith the photograph of "CROESUS." We apologise to all whom
    he may have deceived, but we do not hold ourselves responsible
    for any damage he has caused. We shall publish no more
    financial contributions in the meantime.</p>

    <p>MR. PUNCH, SIR,&mdash;If I start a butcher's business, and
    give my shop the special title of The <i>Welsh</i> Meat Shop,
    is the great British Public so narrow-minded as to expect me to
    sell them only Welsh meat, the produce of Welsh farms only? If
    so, the Public, with all due respect, is a hass. For if I who
    have to live,&mdash;though perhaps others may not see the
    necessity for my existence,&mdash;by my trade, find that the
    Welsh meat, which the Public had expected to be ready and
    waiting, is not forthcoming, only one of two things can I do;
    the one is to shut up shop (which I won't), and the other is to
    provide my intending customers with French, Indian, English,
    Irish, Scotch, American, Australian, New Zealandian, Cape
    Colonial, in fact with any meat I can get from anywhere, and as
    long as it is toothsome, and I can afford to sell it at an
    average price, why should it not be sold at my Royal Welsh Meat
    Shop?</p>

    <p>When I call my shop The Royal Welsh Meat Shop, do I thereby
    bar myself from dealing in English or foreign meats? Do I bar
    myself from dealing in Indian pickles or China oranges? No,
    certainly not; nor do I bar myself from selling neckties,
    gloves, ginger-beer, and Brazil nuts. So, when a House of
    Musical Entertainment is styled The English Opera House, it
    must be understood, "all to the contrary nevertheless and
    notwithstanding," to mean an English House where Opera may be
    performed, and not a Theatre where only English Opera is
    Housed. "My soul can not be fettered," as the poet
    says,&mdash;what poet, I don't know and don't care, but he said
    it, whoever he was, and <i>he was right</i>. If there is no
    English Opera for my House, then I get a French Opera, or a
    Dutch one, just as at an oyster-shop&mdash;but perhaps this is
    not quite the illustration I should like, as, at an
    oyster-shop, they <i>do</i> ask you which you will have,
    "Natives," or "Seconds," or "Anglo-Dutch"; and, when you can't
    afford Natives, you put up with an inferior quality at a lesser
    price. But if that oyster-seller called his shop "The
    Native-Oyster Shop," should I have any ground of action against
    him for selling any other oysters except Natives? No. But then
    he would ask me "If I wanted Natives or not?" And if I said
    "Yes," he would give me Natives. Now I admit I do not ask the
    Public at the doors Which will you have? because I may not be
    able to have an English Opera always on tap, so to speak.
    Metaphors a bit confused, but you know what I mean. If I had a
    few English Operas on tap I might turn 'em on, say, on Mondays,
    Wednesdays and Fridays: English Opera by English Composers on
    those days, and on the other days, any Operas by any Composers.
    But if the Public <i>won't</i> come on the English Opera
    nights, and <i>will</i> come on the other nights? What then?
    Why obviously I must keep my Natives (if I have any) in a
    barrel, and deal only with the foreign supply. "Blame not the
    Bard"&mdash;I mean blame not the patriotic man of business, but
    let our cry be "Art for Art's sake," and the English Opera for
    ever! that is, as long as Art and English Opera pay.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
